AI Studio Project: The project's objective was to develop a machine learning model capable of swiftly classifying entities within a dataset of 10,000 entries as individuals or companies. Tailored for third-party companies with extensive client bases, the project involved the strategic use of web scraping techniques to enhance data collection and model training. Leveraging Python, along with popular libraries such as TensorFlow and sci-kit-learn, we engineered a highly accurate machine learning model. This approach yielded exceptional metrics, including precision, recall, and F1 score consistently above 90%, showcasing the model's effectiveness in classifying entities across various languages (English, Chinese, Arabic, etc.). The incorporation of web scraping allowed for the retrieval of relevant and diverse data, contributing to the robustness of the model. The practical application of this solution aids organizations in rapidly discerning whether their clients are individuals or companies, thereby optimizing service delivery for improved client satisfaction.
